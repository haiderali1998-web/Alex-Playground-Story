    <!-- Story information -->
    <p>
        Alex runs as fast as he can up the stairs of the old house. Upon entering a random room in fear,
        he found a room to be with little signs of life with the dust floating around the room with an old
        mirror on the floor, balancing against the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
        When Alex investigated it, suddenly his reflection didn't move an inch - it just stared back at him
        with wide eyes. Suddenly, his reflection grinned and laughed creepily before stepping out of the mirror.
    </p>
    <p>The real Alex was pulled inside the mirror, stuck in the dusty reflection - trapped forever and his fate sealed.</p>
