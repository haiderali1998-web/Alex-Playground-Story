    <p>Horror games thrive on tension, atmosphere, and the fear of the unknown. 
       They're built around player choices, eerie environments, and the constant question: 
       “What’s waiting around the corner?”</p>
    <p>This space is where our players share theories, reactions, and ideas. 
       Whether you’ve uncovered a secret or want to talk about your favorite twist, 
       your voice helps shape the future of Alex's story.</p>
