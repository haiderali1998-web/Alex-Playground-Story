<p>Alex climbed the slide's ladder carefully but as he reached the top, he felt a sudden chill that made his whole body shiver.</p>
<p>As he looked down, the bottom of the slide had disappeared but now replaced with a dark void.</p>
<p>Will Alex suddenly kick the shadowy figure behind him or slide down into the dark void?</p>
