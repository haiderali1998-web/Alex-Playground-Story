    <!-- Story information -->
    <p>
        Alex steadily approached the purple portal with caution, he poked it for a minute to test it but found 
		no warning signs. With a deep breath and his eyes shut in fear, Alex stepped through the purple 
		portal. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The purple portal sent him through swiftly but when Alex opened his eyes, the portal revealed 
		nothing. It was all black as if someone put a cloth over Alex’s eyes. Quickly Alex realises 
		something isn’t right; he looked behind him to find the portal is gone.  
		He realises the purple portal was a trap – an abyss that would seal his fate to never escape.
