        <!-- Story information -->
        <!-- Introduction to the page of the story -->
        <p>Alex turned around carefully at the low noise of the shadowy figure behind him.</p>
        <p>Alex panicked and kicked the shadow which made the shadow stumble backwards, away from Alex.</p>
        <p>
            Alex ran as fast as he could back towards the comfort of his own home, where he knew he would be safe
            from what is lingering in the mysterious playground.
