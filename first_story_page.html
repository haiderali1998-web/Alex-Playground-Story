    <!-- Introduction to the page of the story -->
    <p>It was late that one evening when Alex wandered into the old, abandoned playground.</p>
    <p>The rusty swings in the distance creaked in the wind as Alex observed them, and the slide stood tall like a silent watchtower looming over him.</p>
    <p>Alex shivered as he felt that something was off, but his curiosity got the better of him.</p>
    <!-- Prompt for user choice -->
    <p>Will Alex approach the swings?</p>
    <!-- Button to progress to swings page -->
