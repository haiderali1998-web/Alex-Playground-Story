    <!-- Introduction to the page of the story -->
    <p>Alex approached the green portal with caution, he poked it for a minute to test it but found no warning signs.
        With a deep breath and his eyes shut in fear, Alex stepped through the green portal.</p>
    <p>The green portal sent him through swiftly but when Alex opened his eyes, the portal took him back to the playground.
        Alex sighed in relief until he felt a mysterious aura in the air - something wasn't right, it was different to before.</p>
    <p>He looked around him in fear, locking sights on the swing as it moved on its own and pushed him back into the portal.
        As he went through the portal, a mysterious shadowy hand grabbed his leg, pulling him in, making Alex screech in fear.</p>
    <p>He stopped to look at the hand, recognising it as his own mother's hand. The rusty wedding ring glowed in the dark aura
        surrounding them. Alex yelps in fear and cries out for mercy from his mother, but the hand crushes his leg and kills him
        in a swift moment.</p>
