    <!-- Introduction to the page of the story -->
    <p>Alex landed hard on a wooden floor. He was aware of the new surroundings; 
        he wasn't in the playground anymore. Instead he was inside a dimly lit eerie house.</p>
    <p>The air was dry around him, the walls were covered in scratches and mysterious stains.
        A door in his sight creaked open on it's own. Alex, now scared, had two choices to make.</p>
    
        <!-- Giving an option to the user for the next page -->
    <p>Will Alex go upstairs, or will he go down to the basement?</p>
