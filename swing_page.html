    <p>Alex moved carefully into the secluded area, approaching the swings with caution.</p>
    <p>They moved slightly on their own, making a creak with every swing, even though there was no wind. </p>
    <p>He hesitated to approach them, but then he gave one a push.</p>
<div>
    <p>Nothing happened at first, but then a shadowy figure came behind him suddenly, just out of sight.</p>
    <p>Alex was starting to feel uneasy; he stepped back and looked toward the slide, wanting to investigate further.</p>
